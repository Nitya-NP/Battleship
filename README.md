# Battleship- Nitya 
A console-based Battleship game written in Java, featuring colored grid displays, player vs. computer gameplay, and score tracking. Players place their ships, take turns shooting at each other's grid, and the first to sink all ships wins!
I built this during my grade 12 as one of my java projects!

# Features
- Colored grid display for clarity: Red = Hit, Green = Ship sunk, Yellow = Miss, Blue = Player grid, Purple = Computer grid, Cyan = Scoreboard
- Interactive player ship placement.
- Randomized AI ship placement and shooting.
- Tracks player and computer scores.
- Checks for sunk ships and prevents duplicate shots.
